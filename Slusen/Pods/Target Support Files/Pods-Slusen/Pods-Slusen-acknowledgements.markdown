      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## MobilePay-AppSwitch-SDK

Danske Bank AppSwitch license terms

Version 2, February 2016

1.Definitions
“Code” means the software (SDK and or API) provided to the Customer by Danske Bank under these terms for MobilePay AppSwitch. 
SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software used for developing applications for a specific device or operating system.
API (Application Program Interface) is a set of commands, functions, and protocols which can be used to call the Danske Bank backend.

2.Granting of license
Danske Bank grants the Customer a non-exclusive, time-limited, non-transferrable right to copy, modify, merge and use the code and documentation in those countries in which the Customer has been given permission to use AppSwitch. The code may be used only for the Customer’s own internal business purposes. The license is granted until the expiry or termination of the terms according to which the Customer has been given permission to use the code, or these terms, howsoever caused. The aforesaid is subject to the Customer meeting the standards and specifications set out in these terms or any other terms agreed between Danske Bank and the Customer regarding the use of the code.

3.Versioning
The SDK is versioned according to the following setup: {MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}. Major and minor version changes cover new functionality and determine whether or not support is provided. Patch changes in a version are small upgrades that do not affect the Customer’s right to support. 

The APIs is only versioned with {MAJOR}, but each service under the APIs may have different versions. 

Generally, support is provided up to three versions back from the most recently released version of the SDK and the API, however, support will always be provided at least for one year for all released versions of the SDK.

Example: Version 1.8.0 has just been released – available versions are 1.5.0, 1.6.4, 1.7.1, and 1.8.0. This means that version 1.5.0 is no longer supported, and all users of this version must therefore upgrade to at least version 1.6.0 in order to be entitled to support. If a 1.8.1 version is released, no upgrade is necessary since only a patch has been released which does not count towards the three latest versions.
 
Danske Bank retains the right, however, to announce the expiry of support for certain versions. In such case, the announcement of expiry will be made at least one year in advance. If the Customer wants to continue to be entitled to support, then an upgrade to a newer version may be necessary after such announcement has been made.
 
If a security issue or breach is discovered, a patch is released. In this situation, an upgrade to the latest version is enforced, and customers must upgrade within an agreed timeframe. This means that all versions prior to the security fix will be nullified and unsupported.


4.Disclaimer of warranty
The code is provided “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or condition of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. The Customer is responsible solely for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the code and assumes any risks associated with the Customer’s exercise of permissions under the license.

5.Limitation of liability
In no event will Danske Bank or its contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits; or business interruption) however caused, whether in contract, strict liability or tort arising in any way out of the use of this code. 

6.Open Source software
The SDK may include source code which is licensed under an open source license agreement (“MIT License”). Use of the Open Source Software is subject those terms and conditions. The Licensee accepts to be bound by and comply with all such terms and conditions. Danske Bank disclaims any liability for any third party claims, including, but not limited to, any infringement claims, relating to the Customer’s use of the Open Source Software.

7.Assignment
The Customer may not assign its rights and obligations under these terms in any way without Danske Bank's prior written consent. 

8.Termination
Upon expiry or termination of use of AppSwitch and according to these terms, howsoever caused, Danske Bank disables the merchant ID provided by Danske Bank to the Customer for the use of this code, and the Customer can no longer use the code provided under these terms.
